Unlike traditional BitTorrent, however, \"zites\" (ZeroNet sites) can be updated after they have been originally published while retaining the same key and peers.\nBecause ZeroNet is not a client-server network, traditional website applications like WordPress that require server-side languages like PHP will not work on it.

This way one not-so-trusted domain, e.g. the one where Thunderbird is running, can delegate all crypto operations – such as encryption/decryption and signing – to another, more trusted, network-isolated domain. This way the compromise of your domain where Thunderbird or another client app is running – arguably a not-so-unthinkable scenario – does not allow the attacker to automatically also steal all your keys. (We should make a rather obvious comment here that the so-often-used passphrases on private keys are pretty meaningless because the attacker can easily set up a simple backdoor which would wait until the user enters the passphrase and steal the key then.)",

              "description": "ShredOS.ShredOS is a USB bootable (BIOS or UEFI) small linux distribution with the sole purpose of securely erasing the entire contents of your disks using the program nwipe. If you are familiar with dwipe from DBAN then you will feel right at home with ShredOS and nwipe. What are the advantages of nwipe over dwipe/DBAN? Well as everybody probably knows, DBAN development stopped in 2015 which means it has not received any further bug fixes or support for new hardware since that date. Nwipe originally was a fork of dwipe but has continued to have improvements and bug fixes and is now available in many Linux distros. ShredOS hopefully will always provide the latest nwipe on a up to date Linux kernel so it will support modern hardware.\n\nShredOS supports either 32bit or 64bit processors. You will need to download the appropriate 64bit or 32bit .img or .iso file, depending upon your target processor and whether you want to burn ShredOS to a USB memory stick, in which case you would download the .img file. Alternatively, if you wanted to burn ShredOS to CD/DVD, then you would download the .iso file.\n\nBecause ShredOS boots and runs straight from a USB flash drive or DVD/CD, it doesn't matter what operating system already exists on the computer. It will remove all data/directories/operating systems, from the drive or drives you have selected for wiping, leaving a disk with no trace of what originally existed. It will wipe PC's & Intel based MACs, such as MAC Book Pros. It doesn't care what operating system previosuly existed, be it Windows/MAC OSX/Linux/VXWorks.\n\nShredOS can be used as a software image and booted via the network using a client PC that supports Preboot execution environment (PXE) via a PXE enabled server. A procedure for creating a simple UEFI PXE server based on Debian/Ubuntu and serving up ShredOS can be found here #148\n\nYou can also use ShredOS on headless systems or systems with faulty display hardware as it includes a user enabled telnet server. Further details can be found here. How to wipe drives on headless systems or systems with faulty or missing display hardware or keyboards\n\nShredOS includes the latest Nwipe official release, but in addition includes other disk related utilities such as Smartmontools, hdparm, a hexeditor hexedit, and, the program loadkeys which can be used for setting the keyboard layout. Nwipe automatically starts it's GUI in the first virtual terminal (ALT-F1), hdparm, smartmontools and hexeditor can be run in the second virtual terminal, (ALT-F2). Nwipe will erase drives using a user selectable choice of seven methods. hdparm - amongst many of its options - can be used for wiping a drive by issueing ATA erase commands or SAS erase commands interface commands to the firmware of the storrage device. This is a planned feature addition to nwipe.\n\nShredOS boots very quickly and depending upon the host system can boot in as little as 2 seconds (typically 4 to 6 seconds) on modern hardware, while on an old Pentium4 may take 40+ seconds. Nwipe automatically starts in GUI mode and will list the disks present on the host system. In fact, on version of ShredOS earlier than v2023.08.2_25.0_x86-64_0.35 nwipe can launch so fast that the USB devices have not yet initialised so the first time nwipe appears it may not show any USB drives, this behaviour has been fixed from version v2023.08.2_25.0_x86-64_0.35 onwards so there will usually be a delay of about 5-10 seconds while the USB devices are initialised. On older versions of ShredOS you would use Control-C to exit and restart nwipe to see any attached USB devices. You can then select the methods by which you want to securely erase the disk/s. Nwipe is able to simultanuosly wipe multiple disks using a threaded software architecture. I have simultaneously wiped 28 loop devices in tests and know of instances where it's been used to simultaneuosly wipe upwards of fifty drives on a rack server.\n\nThe vanilla version of ShredOS boots into nwipe's GUI and shows the available discs that can then be selected for wiping. It does not autonuke your discs at launch, however it is capable of doing that, if you edit the grub.cfg file and specify the appropriate nwipe command line option. Details of configuring nwipe's launch behaviour is shown below How to run nwipe so you can specify nwipe command line options. https://github.com/PartialVolume/shredos.x86_64"

Files use hashes, meaning if two users publish the same file, that file will be available under the same hash.\nWhile IPFS hashes themselves are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once published, IPFS supports a system called IPNS where the hash can be of a peer themselves instead of the file, enabling mutable (re-writable) files and folders and ultimately websites.",
